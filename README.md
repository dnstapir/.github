# Welcome to DNS TAPIR

The DNS TAPIR project (www.dnstapir.se) aims to create Open Source software for collecting analytics from DNS resolvers while
preserving privacy, and forward data to a central core that aggregates the query statistics in near realtime and suggest
actions based on this back to the edge where the resolver operates.

The software will be released during 2024 and consists of two major parts:

- DNStapir Edge – A service that runs close to a DNS resolver that aggregates logs and forwards data to the cloud service. Installed in service provider’s networks and similar places.
- DNStapir Core – The cloud service that aggregates, analyses and annotates data, and produces different alerts. The cloud service can be divided in a federated network of instances without affecting the user’s privacy.
