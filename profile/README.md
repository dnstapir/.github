# Welcome to DNS TAPIR

The DNS TAPIR project (www.dnstapir.se) aims to create Open Source software for collecting analytics from DNS resolvers while
preserving privacy, and forward data to a central core that aggregates the query statistics in near realtime and suggest
actions based on this back to the edge where the resolver operates.

The software will be released during 2024 and consists of two major parts:

- DNS TAPIR Edge – A service that runs close to a DNS resolver that aggregates logs and
  forwards data to the cloud service. Installed in service provider’s networks and similar places.
- DNS TAPIR Core – The cloud service that aggregates, analyses and annotates data, and produces
  different alerts. The cloud service can be divided in a federated network of instances without affecting
  the user’s privacy. This typically runs in an Internet provider's network.
